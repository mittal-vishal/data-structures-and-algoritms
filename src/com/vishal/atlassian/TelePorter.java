* ðŸ§© The Problem
You're playing a game on a linear board with numbered positions:

The board has positions from 0 to lastNumber (inclusive).

You start at some position: startPosition.

You can roll a die, which gives you a number from 1 to maxValue.

You move forward that many steps.

If your resulting position goes beyond lastNumber, you are placed at lastNumber instead.

Some board positions are teleporters â€” when you land on them, you are instantly moved to a different position.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal
After rolling the die once, find all possible final positions you can end up at, considering:

the possible die values (1 to maxValue),

the teleporters,

and the board boundaries.

ðŸ§ª Example
Letâ€™s say:

lastNumber = 10

startPosition = 2

maxValue = 6

Teleporters: ["3,1", "5,10", "8,2"]
(meaning: land on 3 â†’ teleport to 1, land on 5 â†’ teleport to 10, land on 8 â†’ teleport to 2)

ðŸ§® Step-by-step Execution
From startPosition = 2, we try every possible die roll from 1 to 6:

Die Roll	Landed On	Teleport?	Final Position
1	3	Yes	1
2	4	No	4
3	5	Yes	10
4	6	No	6
5	7	No	7
6	8	Yes	2

So you could end up at: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10.

But we should also handle the case where startPosition + dieRoll > lastNumber â€” then you land on lastNumber.

For example:

If startPosition = 9 and die = 3, you'd get to 12, but thatâ€™s beyond the board, so you'd land on lastNumber = 10.

âœ… Your Task
Implement a function that returns all final positions you can reach after one die roll, taking teleporters and bounds into account.
